I am currently a Principal Researcher at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, working with [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Cornell University, where I was advised by [Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/). From 2022 to 2024, I worked as an Applied Scientist II at [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com).

My research lies broadly in **stochastic optimization and control**, with an emphasis on **stochastic networks and queueing theory**. I study steady-state performance and diffusion control, particularly in heavy-traffic regimes. We pinoneered the notion of **multi-scale heavy traffic** and established the first **product-form limits** for generalized Jackson networks under this regime. I work on resource allocation in parallel-server systems, focusing on steady-state approximations with heterogeneous servers and class-dependent service rates.

I also work on **stochastic matching in high-dimensional settings**. I design dynamic matching policies through tractable approximations that balance matching value and congestion costs in large markets - such as ride-hailing and labor platforms - where high-dimensional control is essential and remains relatively underexplored in the literature.

A more recent direction of interest is **LLM inference** viewed through the lens of stochastic networks. Modern LLM serving systems operate as large-scale service networks with batching, routing, and congestion under tight latency constraints. I am developing heavy-traffic approximations and queueing-based control to analyze and improve inference efficiency at scale.
