I am currently a Principal Researcher at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, under the supervision of [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D in Statisctics at Cornell University, advised by [Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/). Prior to that, I received M.S. in Probability and Mathematical Statistics, B.S. in Mathematics(Statistics) from Shandong University. From 2022 to 2024, I worked as an Applied Scientist at [Amazon.com](amazon.com).

My research interests lies in the theory of stochastic networks, focusing on the steady-state performance approximation in the heavy traffic regime; resource allocations in processing networks; high-dimensional statistics. I have been developing BAR approach that works directly with the stationary distribution of each pre-limit system, instead of proving a stochastic process limit followed by a limit interchange â€“ a method that dominates the literature. We are the first to study the product form limit under generalized Jackson Network under the multi-scale heavy traffic regime. We are the first to study the steady-state approximation under weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) policy in the general parallel-server network with heterogeneous servers.
