I am currently a Principal Researcher at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, working with [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Cornell University, where I was advised by [Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/). From 2022 to 2024, I worked as an Applied Scientist II at [Amazon.com](amazon.com).

My research interests lie in stochastic networks and queueing theory, with a focus on steady-state performance analysis and stochastic control in the heavy-traffic regime. We pioneered the notion of the **multi-scale heavy-traffic** regime, and were the first to study the **product-form limit for generalized Jackson networks** under this setting. I also study resource allocation in **parallel-server** processing networks, focusing on steady-state approximations under heterogeneous servers and class-dependent service rates.

I also work on **stochastic matching in high-dimensional** settings. We design dynamic matching policies via a tractable formulation that balances matching value and congestion costs in large-scale marketsâ€”such as ride-hailing and labor platformsâ€”where high-dimensional control is critical but remains largely unexplored in the literature.
